# Bucks Capital Application System

## Overview
This system replaces the external Google Forms with an integrated application form that allows students to apply directly on the website. All applications are stored locally and can be viewed by administrators.

## Features

### For Students
- **Integrated Application Form**: Students can apply directly on the website without being redirected to external forms
- **Comprehensive Form**: Collects all necessary information including:
  - Personal information (name, email, phone)
  - Academic information (grade, GPA, school)
  - Position of interest
  - Relevant experience
  - Motivation for joining
  - Availability
  - Additional information
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation ensures all required fields are completed correctly
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear feedback when application is submitted successfully

### For Administrators
- **Application Viewer**: View all submitted applications at `/admin`
- **Detailed View**: Click on any application to see full details
- **Export Functionality**: Export all applications to CSV format
- **Application Management**: Delete applications as needed
- **Local Storage**: All applications are stored in browser's localStorage

## How to Use

### For Students
1. Navigate to the "Join Us" section on the About page
2. Click the "Apply Now" button
3. Fill out the comprehensive application form
4. Submit the application
5. Receive confirmation that the application was submitted

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to `/admin` to view all applications
2. Use the "View" button to see full application details
3. Use the "Export CSV" button to download all applications
4. Use the "Delete" button to remove applications as needed

## Technical Details

### Components Created
- `ApplicationForm.tsx`: The main application form with validation
- `ApplicationModal.tsx`: Modal dialog to display the form
- `ApplicationViewer.tsx`: Admin interface to view applications
- `Admin.tsx`: Admin page component

### Data Storage
- Applications are stored in `localStorage` under the key `bucksCapitalApplications`
- Each application includes:
  - All form data
  - Unique ID
  - Submission timestamp
  - Status (defaults to "pending")

### Form Validation
- Uses `react-hook-form` with `zod` schema validation
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- Required fields are clearly marked

### Integration Points
- Updated all "Apply Now" buttons throughout the site to use the new modal
- Replaced Google Forms links in:
  - About page (main Apply Now button)
  - Footer sections across all pages
  - Contact sections

## Future Enhancements
- Backend integration for persistent storage
- Email notifications for new applications
- Application status management
- Bulk actions for administrators
- Application analytics and reporting

## Security Considerations
- Currently uses localStorage (client-side only)
- For production, consider implementing:
  - Server-side storage
  - User authentication for admin access
  - Data encryption
  - Rate limiting for form submissions

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers that support localStorage
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices
